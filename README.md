#Â Customer Segments Unsupervised Learning
## Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Project 3

This project aims to segmentate a database of customers based on their buying preferences. As we learn along the path, there are patterns in the data we can assess using PCA, this way we can check how the buying preferences of the custumers explain better the variance on the data. After doing this, clustering methods were applied, K-means and GMM. After that, we check with the correct labels we took away at the begining, how well our model performs.

**customer_segments.ipynb**: This file has the complete process, from data extraction from the **customers.csv** file to data visualization, PCA, K-means, GMM and the confusion matrix against the real labels.

**renders.py**: It is an auxiliary file that helps format the plots for the clusters.
